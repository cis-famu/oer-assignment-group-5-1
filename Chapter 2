A section per topic:

2.1 A Quick Look at a C++ Program
In this chapter, you will learn the basic elements and concepts of the C++ programming language to create C++ programs. In addition to giving examples to illustrate various concepts, we will also show C++ programs to clarify these concepts. Every C++ program has a function called main. Thus, if a C++ program has only one function, it must be the function main.

2.2 The Basics of a C++ Program
Comments:
Typically, comments can be used to identify the authors of the program, give the date when the program is written or modified, give a brief explanation of the program, and explain the meaning of key statements in a program. Comments are for the reader, not for the compiler. So when a compiler compiles a program to check for the syntax errors, it completely ignores comments. Throughout this book, comments are shown in green.

Special Symbols:
The smallest individual unit of a program written in any language is called a token. C++’s tokens are divided into special symbols, word symbols, and identifiers. 
Following are some of the special symbols:

Reserved Words:
Reserved words are also called keywords.Furthermore, reserved words cannot be redefined within any program; that is, they cannot be used for anything other than their intended use.

Whitespaces:
Every C++ program contains whitespaces. Whitespaces include blanks, tabs, and newline characters. In a C++ program, whitespaces are used to separate special symbols, reserved words, and identifiers. They can be used to make the program more readable.
2.3 Data Types
The objective of a C++ program is to manipulate data. Different programs manipulate different data. Although at first it may seem confusing, by being so type conscious, C++ has built-in checks to guard against errors.
C++ data types fall into the following three categories:

Simple data type

Structured data type

Pointers
2.4 Data Types, Variables, and Assignment Statements

2.5 Arithmetic Operators, Operator Precedence, and Expressions

2.6 Type Conversion (Casting)

2.7 string Type

2.8 Variables, Assignment Statements, and Input Statements

When you instruct the computer to allocate memory, you tell it not only what names to use for each memory location, but also what type of data to store in those memory locations. 
Some data must stay the same throughout a program. For example, the conversion formula that converts inches into centimeters is fixed, because 1 inch is always equal to 2.54 centimeters. When stored in memory, this type of data needs to be protected from accidental changes during program execution.
When a variable is declared, C++ may not automatically put a meaningful value in it. In other words, C++ may not automatically initialize variables. For example, the int and double variables may not be initialized to 0, as happens in some programming languages. 



2.9 Increment and Decrement Operators

2.10 Output

2.11 Preprocessor Directives

2.12 Creating a C++ Program

A C++ program is a collection of functions, one of which is the function main. Therefore, if a C++ program consists of only one function, then it must be the function main. 
You can divide a C++ program into two parts: preprocessor directives and the program. The basic parts of the function main are the heading and the body. The first line of the function main, that is int main()

2.13 Debugging: Understanding and Fixing Syntax Errors

When you type a program, typos and unintentional syntax errors are likely to occur. Therefore, when you compile a program, the compiler will identify the syntax error. In this section, we show how to identify and fix syntax errors. It is best to try to correct the errors in top-down fashion because the first error may confuse the compiler and cause it to flag multiple subsequent errors when actually there was only one error on an earlier line. So, let’s first consider the following error:

2.14 Program Style and Form

In C++, you use one or more blanks to separate numbers when data is input. Blanks are also used to separate reserved words and identifiers from each other and from other symbols. Blanks must never appear within a reserved word or identifier. It is very common for the omission of a single character to cause four or five error messages. However, when the first syntax error is removed and the program is recompiled, subsequent syntax errors caused by this syntax error may disappear.

Review Questions:
What function does every C++ program have? ans main

WHat does the compiler ignore: ans commas

Summary:
* Reserved words cannot be used as identifiers in a program.

* All reserved words in C++ consist of lowercase letters (see Appendix A).

* In C++, identifiers are names of things.

* A C++ identifier consists of letters, digits, and underscores and must begin with a letter or underscore.

* Whitespaces include blanks, tabs, and newline characters.

* A data type is a set of values together with a set of allowed operations.

* C++ data types fall into the following three categories: simple, structured, and pointers.

* There are three categories of simple data: integral, floating point, and enumeration.

Key Terms:

Data type double, float, long double: used to manuoulate decimal numbers

Mixed expression: an expression that consist of both integers and decimal numbers

"\": escape character
