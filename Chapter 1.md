Introduction C++ Programming 

**OER Group-5 Chapter #1**

Objective: this first chapter will help to gain an overall knowledge of C++ and its evolution; along with the steps to write a completed C++ program.

This chapter covers:
* Summarize the history and evolution of programming languages
* Identify the elements of a computer-hardware, software, operating systems, and languages
* Distinguish the components of machine language
* Define the processes of a C++ program
* List the steps in problem analysis coding
* Differentiate programming methodologies
* Compare programming languages
* Define ANSI/ISO Standard C++

* Introduction: Without software, a computer cannot work. Software is developed by using programming languages. C++ is one of the programming languages, which is well suited for developing software to accomplish specific tasks. With the knowledge in this Chapter, we will learn to better our C++ programming skills and write proficent programs. 
  

* A Brief Overview of the History of Computers:

  The first device known to carry out calculations was the abacus. If you do not know what an abacus is, it is the picture listed below. The abacus was invented in Asia but was used in ancient Babylon, China, and throughout Europe until the late middle ages. The abacus uses a system of sliding beads in a rack for addition and subtraction. In time, this device has been innovated into other computer forms in many shapes and sizes. The computers that we know today use the design rules given by John von Neumann in the late 1940s. His design included components such as an arithmetic logic unit, a control unit, memory, and input/output devices.

  * Elements of a Computer System

  A computer is a system capable of completing countless programs. The two main components of a computer system is hardware and software. One example of computer hardware is a CPU (Central Processing Unit)

  * The Language of a Computer
  What is the language of the computer? Machine code, also known as machine language, is the elemental language of computers. It is read by the computer's central processing unit (CPU), is composed of digital binary numbers and looks like a very long sequence of zeros and ones. Also, because digital signals are processed inside a computer, the language of a computer, called machine language, is a sequence of 0s and 1s. The digit 0 or 1 is called a binary digit, or bit. Sometimes a sequence of 0s and 1s is referred to as a binary code or a binary number .

  * The Evolution of programming languages
Moving from machine language to assembly language made programming easier, but a programmer was still forced to think in terms of individual machine instructions. The next step toward making programming easier was to devise high-level languages that were closer to natural languages, such as English, French, German, and Spanish. Basic, FORTRAN, COBOL, C, C++, C#, Java, and Python are all high-level languages. You will learn the high-level language C++ in this book.

  * Processing a C++ program



  * Programming with the Problem Analysis-Coding-Execution Cycle



  * Programming Methodologies
    
Two popular approaches to programming design are the structured approach and the object-oriented approach. Dividing a problem into smaller subproblems is a common practice called structured design. Dividing a problem into smaller subproblems. Object-oriented design (OOD) is a widely used programming methodology. In OOD, the first step in the problem-solving process is to identify the components called objects, which form the basis of the solution, and to determine how these objects interact with one another.

  * ANSI/ISO Standard C++
The programming language C++ evolved from C and was designed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s. C++ programs were not always portable from one compiler to another.To address this problem, in the early 1990s, a joint committee of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) was established to standardize the syntax of C++.

* Review Questions:

What are 3 types of computer software? Ans. Excel, Word, Powerpoint

What does OOD stand for? A: object-observering design. B: object-oriented design. C: oriented-object design. Ans: B

What was the first known computer? A: 1996 Apple Mac. B: abacus. C: Microsoft Surface. Ans: B


* Summary:
 * Two popular approaches to programming design are the structured approach and the object-oriented approach
 * The structured-design approach is also known as top-down design, bottom-up design, stepwise refinement, and modular programming.
 * 1998, ANSI/ISO C++ language standards were approved. Most of todayâ€™s compilers comply with these new standards.
 * When the power is switched off, everything in the main memory is lost.
 * Software are programs run by the computer.
 * A bit is a binary digit, 0 or 1.
 * Six steps are needed to execute a C++ program: edit, preprocess, compile, link, load, and execute.

   
* Key Terms:
  *Main memory or random access memory: is connected directly to the CPU.
  *Memory cells: an ordered sequence of the cells in main memory.
  *Address: is a unique location in main memory for each cell.
  *Secondary storage: a device that stores information permanently.
  *Input devices: a device that feeds data and programs into a computer.
  *Output devices:a device that the computer uses to display the results.
  *Object-oriented design (OOD): is a widely used programming methodology.
  *Central processing unit (CPU): is the brain of the computer.
  *Compiler:a program that translates instructions written in a high-level language into the equivalent     machine language.;



* Programming exercises:
  
int dollars; // line 1

int cents; 

double grams; 

dollars = 1; // line 4 

cents = 90; 

grams = 3.0;
