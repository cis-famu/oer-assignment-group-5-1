Introduction C++ Programming 

**OER Group-5 Chapter #1**

Objective: this first chapter will help to gain an overall knowledge of C++ and its evolution; along with the steps to write a completed C++ program.

This chapter covers:
* Summarize the history and evolution of programming languages
* Identify the elements of a computer-hardware, software, operating systems, and languages
* Distinguish the components of machine language
* Define the processes of a C++ program
* List the steps in problem analysis coding
* Differentiate programming methodologies
* Compare programming languages
* Define ANSI/ISO Standard C++

* Introduction: Without software, a computer cannot work. Software is developed by using programming languages. C++ is one of the programming languages, which is well suited for developing software to accomplish specific tasks. With the knowledge in this Chapter, we will learn to better our C++ programming skills and write proficent programs. 
  

* A Brief Overview of the History of Computers:

  The first device known to carry out calculations was the abacus. If you do not know what an abacus is, it is the picture listed below. The abacus was invented in Asia but was used in ancient Babylon, China, and throughout Europe until the late middle ages. The abacus uses a system of sliding beads in a rack for addition and subtraction. In time, this device has been innovated into other computer forms in many shapes and sizes. The computers that we know today use the design rules given by John von Neumann in the late 1940s. His design included components such as an arithmetic logic unit, a control unit, memory, and input/output devices.

  * Elements of a Computer System

  A computer is a system capable of completing countless programs. The two main components of a computer system is hardware and software. One example of computer hardware is a CPU (Central Processing Unit)

* Summary:

* Key Terms:
Main memory or random access memory: is connected directly to the CPU.
Memory cells: an ordered sequence of the cells in main memory.
Address: is a unique location in main memory for each cell.
Secondary storage: a device that stores information permanently.
Input devices: a device that feeds data and programs into a computer.
Output devices:a device that the computer uses to display the results.
Object-oriented design (OOD): is a widely used programming methodology.
Central processing unit (CPU): is the brain of the computer.
Compiler:a program that translates instructions written in a high-level language into the equivalent machine language.;

Six steps are needed to execute a C++ program: edit, preprocess, compile, link, load, and execute.
