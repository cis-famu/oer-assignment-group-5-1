Chapter 4 OER
Introduction C++ Programming

OER Group-5 Chapter #4

After completing this chapter students will be able to:
1. Use control structures
2. Use selection syntax
3. Identifying bugs and how to avoid them
4. Use Boolean expressions effectively.
   
Introduction: 
In this Chapter, we read how to tell a computer it is incorrect regarding its sequential order; along with making decisions until specified conditions are met. 


A section per topic:
4.1 Control Structures: 

4.2 Relational Operators and s t r i n g Type

4.3 Using Psuedocode to Develop, Test, and Debug a Program

4.4 s w i t c h Structures:

4.5 Terminating a Program with the a s s e r t Function 


Review Questions:
* What do control structures do? ans: They alter the normal flow of execution.
* How many selection structures are there in C++? ans: 2
* What is s w i t c h? ans: It is a structure used to handle multiple selections 

Summary:
* Including a space within relational operators can cause syntax errors.
* Characters are compared using a machine's collating sequence.
* Logical expressions evaluate to 1 (true) or 0 (false).
* Selection structures in C++ include one-way and two-way selections.
* Programs can be terminated using the a s s e r t fumnction if conditions are not met in a program. 

Key Terms:
* !=: Not equal to 
* Semantic error: Error due to invalid user writing
* a s s e r t: used to terminate functions

Programming excercises: 
Evaluate 6 * 6 == 90/7

'9' <= '8'
