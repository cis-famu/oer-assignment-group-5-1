Introduction C++ Programming

OER Group-5 Chapter #3

After completing this chapter students will be able to:
Identify and use control structures
Identify logical and relational operators, how they work, and order of precedence
Distinguish the relationship of relational operators and simple data types
Identify how to form and evaluate logical (Boolean) expressions
Use one-way and/or two-way selection syntax
Demonstrate a switch statement in a program

Introduction: 
Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to:

Identify input and output streams
Read data from the standard input device
Define the use predefined functions in a program
Describe input stream functions get, ignore, putback, and peek
Write data to the standard output device
Use manipulators in a program to format output
Perform input and output operations using the string data type
Distinguish how to use debug logic errors

A section per topic:

3.1 I/O Streams and Standard I/O Devices

3.2 Using Predefined Functions in a Program

3.3 Input Failure

3.4 Output and Formatting Output

3.5 Additional Output Formatting Tools

3.6 Input/Output and the string type 

3.7 Debugging: Understanding Logic Errors and Debugging with cout Statements

3.8 File Input/Output 

Review Questions:


Summary:
* A stream in C++ is an infinite sequence of characters from a source to a destination.

* An input stream is a stream from a source to a computer.

* An output stream is a stream from a computer to a destination.

* When inputting data into a variable, the operator >> skips all leading whitespace characters.

* When inputting data into a variable, the operator >> skips all leading whitespace characters.

Key Terms:

Ignore: used to kip data in a line 

cin (common input): used to initialize the standard output device 

Output stream: a stream from the computer to a destination.
